# Project Title : Lasso and Ridge Regression implementation
## About
### In this project,we have firstly implemented LINEAR REGRESSION model on the given dataset imported from sklearn  Library.After creating and implementing the model,we found that there is a case of Overfitting.To Optimize Overfitting and to get higher accuracy on the test data we have implemented the LASSO and RIDGE REGRESSION model.





## Queries

#### Question 1 : which is the best model for the given dataset?

#### Answer 1 : Since we have implemented all the three models namely Linear,Ridge,Lasso Regression,both Lasso/Ridge Regression model can be used and hyence the best model.

#### Question 2 : How do you remove the overfitting caused by Linear Regression?

#### Answer 2 : To optimize the Overfiiting caused due to Linear Regression,we have implemented the Lasso or Ridge regression.

  
## Roadmap

- Data Understanding

- Data Preprocessing
- Linear Regression Model implementation
- Ridge Regression Model implementation
- Lasso Regression model implementation
- Comparision among all the models
- Best model detected
